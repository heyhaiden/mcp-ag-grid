## Quick Start

### 1. First Steps - Testing the Connection

**You:** Test if the AG Grid server is working

**Claude:** I'll test the AG Grid MCP server by checking what tools and resources are available.

*[Claude will list available tools and confirm the server is running]*

### 2. Load a Demo Scenario

**You:** Load the sales dashboard demo scenario

**Claude:** I'll load a pre-built sales dashboard scenario for you.

*[Claude will create a grid with sample sales data]*

## Basic Grid Creation

### Example 1: Creating a Simple Product Inventory Grid

**You:** Create a grid for product inventory with the following data:
- iPhone 15: 50 units, $999 each
- MacBook Pro: 25 units, $1999 each  
- iPad Air: 75 units, $599 each
- Apple Watch: 100 units, $399 each

Include columns for product name, units in stock, unit price, and total value.

**Expected Result:** Claude will create an AG Grid with:
- Sortable and filterable columns
- Calculated total value column
- Professional formatting
- Grid ID for further operations

**Sample Conversation:**

```
Claude: I'll create a product inventory grid for you with the data provided.

[Uses create_grid tool with:]
- columnDefs: product, unitsInStock, unitPrice, totalValue
- rowData: Your inventory items with calculated totals
- Grid features: sorting, filtering, number formatting

Your inventory grid has been created successfully! Grid ID: grid_123456

The grid shows:
- 4 products total
- 250 total units in stock  
- $162,475 total inventory value
- Sortable by any column
- Filterable for quick searches

Would you like me to apply any filters or sort the data in a specific way?
```

### Example 2: Employee Directory

**You:** Create an employee directory grid with departments, salaries, and contact information. Use the built-in sample employee data.

**Expected Flow:**
1. Claude loads sample employee data
2. Creates grid with appropriate columns
3. Offers analysis options

## Data Analysis Workflows

**Expected Analysis:**
```
Claude: I'll analyze the data quality of our employee dataset.

[Uses get_grid_stats tool]

Data Quality Report:
üìä Dataset Overview:
- Total employees: 50
- Columns: 14
- Data completeness: 98.5%

üîç Missing Values:
- Manager field: 2 missing (4%)

## Advanced Filtering and Sorting

### Example 5: Complex Business Queries

**You:** From the sales data, show me:
- Sales over $10,000 from Q4 2024
- Only from North America and Europe
- Sorted by profit margin descending
- Group by sales rep performance

**Advanced Filtering Workflow:**

```
Claude: I'll apply multiple filters to analyze high-value Q4 sales from your key regions.

[Step 1: Apply date filter]
Filtering for Q4 2024 (Oct-Dec)...
‚úì 32 records found

[Step 2: Revenue filter]  
Adding revenue filter > $10,000...
‚úì 18 records remain

[Step 3: Regional filter]
Limiting to North America and Europe...
‚úì 12 records in final dataset

[Step 4: Sort by profit margin]
Sorting by profit margin (highest first)...

Top Results:
1. John Smith - MacBook Pro sale: 45.2% margin, $15,750 revenue
2. Sarah Johnson - iPhone 15 bulk: 42.8% margin, $12,400 revenue  
3. Michael Chen - Surface Studio: 38.5% margin, $11,200 revenue
